Well, SeaGL 2021 happened and we're [on cloud nine](https://seagl.org/news/2021/10/27/seagl-2021-theme.html).
Our second virtual SeaGL was terrific.
It was great to be able to connect with folks from around the world and share our love of free software and free culture.
The social events were delightful, too.

There are so many people we want to thank.
The keynotes from Marie Nordin, Christine Lemmer-Webber, Dr. Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Elana Hashman, and Cory Doctorow were awesome.
And truly, all of the talks were great.
Thank you to our speakers for taking time to share with the community.
Be sure to check your email for information about the speaker gifts!

SeaGL couldn't happen without our wonderful volunteers.
Thank you to everyone who helped with speakers, built our platform, designed our social media images, advised the career expo, and all of the other things that go on for months behind the scenes.
SeaGL is a grassroots conference, and our volunteers are what keep it that way.
If you want to be a part of SeaGL 2022, it's never too early to think about [volunteering](https://seagl.org/news/2021/10/05/volunteers-2021.html).

Even a volunteer-run conference has expenses, though, so we also have to thank our [sponsors](https://seagl.org/sponsors/2021).
In particular, we want to thank our platinum sponsors—[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/) and [JMP](https://jmp.chat/)—as well as our gold sponsors—[C-SATS](https://www.csats.com/), [Google](https://google.com), [Schedules Direct](https://www.schedulesdirect.org/), and the [Ubuntu Community Fund](https://ubuntu.com/community).
Thanks also to our silver and bronze sponsors, our media sponsors, and the other organizations and projects that helped make SeaGL 2021 a great success.

We can't wait for you to join us November 4–5, 2022 for the *tenth!* year of SeaGL!
